      <p >Programming is obviously a big part of my degree and being comfortable with code is very important.I am not new to Programming
        and have had some experience with coding in VB, C and Javascript.I had no experince in coding in Python and unfortunantely this is the language that
        we are using in the first half of the year. Having knowledge of programmming concepts made it easy to learn Python but to polish my skills and to get a
        bit more used to the language, I attended the Developer's Society Python Basics Workshop.
      </p>
      <p >This was targeted for first year students like me who wanted to polish their skills or needed a bit more help with understanding
        the concepts of Python programming.The session was led by ,principle committee member , Joshua Walters. A fellow computer science student.He shared his
        experience with the languge and the tips and tricks to make it easier to learn , practise and code in the language. It was an interactive session and he did
        take questions and there was a bit of a code along bit at the beginning.

      <p >There was a second workshop for html and css in relation to the Web strand assignment.This was similar to the python workshop and we were given a chance to ask questions on things we were
         struggling with in our own websites.This also provided helpful tips in regards to accessibility and reminders on how to incorparate these guidelines into our own websites.</p>

      <p >The Devloper's Society or DevSoc as it is also known , is a society at NTU that focuses on all things IT.After my experience with the workshop
        I am considering joining the society as this could not only help my course but could introduce me to new things within the IT world. I was on their website and
        a number of the committee members have their own personal websites where they showcase some of their projects.The projects were very cool and interesting.
        The answer to how to code is coding and this society could help me with that.
