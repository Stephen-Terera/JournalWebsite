        <p class=" spacing">The Univeristy of Nottingham held a public lecture on Artificial Intelligence.For me this has always been an area of interest and as a computer
          science student this could be a potential job field for me.The lecture was presented by Dr. Colin Johnson. I enjoyed the hour long lecture and it was not overcomplicated
          and easy to listen to. The main focus was to answer or atleast start the conversation of whether a robot can do most of the jobs that are currently done by humans and
          the implications of having robots actually taking these jobs over.Before the lecture my initial thoughts were that robots could take over our jobs and this would be a great thing.
          I had not at all considered the effects of this.After the lecture I had a slightly revised view of robots taking over our jobs.

        <p >
          An alternative scenerio is that most jobs will not be done by robots but the humans will be supervised by a robot.An example given in the lecture was that imagine
          at at helpline company as the workers are taking calls, a robot monitors their tone ,alertness and things of that nature.The robot will be able to tell if you are actually
          help the person on the line by your tone of voice and if you are sleeping on the job it will be able to tell.This would mean that the robot is the boss.This right now
          seems crazy but could be normal in the future.If robots were to take our jobs,this could drastically change the economy with a large number of people being unemployed
          and the owners of these robot companies could potential become trillionairs.This obviously is just one way it could pan out and it will not happen over time 
          but it could potentially happen.This unknown space that we are entering is a bit scary  but I am sure that is how people felt when the first computers were coming 
          about and we ended up fine.
