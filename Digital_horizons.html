        <h2> Digital Horizons</h2>
        <p >My Digital Horizons week was unfortunately uneventful.I had hoped that I would be on campus by the time this came
          around but it was not to be.Rather than mope about it I attended the online support surgeries for my module strands
          and it was good revision for the things we had done in the first seven weeks.This week was also a reading week so it gave me a chance to read some 
        of my work material that I did not fully understand the first time.This did not contribute to any CPD points but it was better than not doing anything 
        and using being at home as an excuse for not being productive during this week. </p>

          <p >I did attend a employer Q and A session that was hosted by IBM.A poplular company,one which has played a significant role in the evolution
          of computers.It was interesting to hear about their internship program and how to apply.We were also given an insight into what life would be like
          as an intern or placement student working at IBM. I find these employer sessions important because although It is easy to just google what a company does
          ,hearing about their culture and identity could influence where a dream job at a company could be.</p>

        <p > There is another employer session that I will be attending and although it has not yet happened and when it does it will no longer
        be digital horizons i think it will be as interesting as the IBM session. The employer hosting the session is <b>Electronic Arts</b>
        I am a lover of video games and working at EA and finding out what it is like to work there would be the first step.
        These sessions allow us to ask question on how to apply for placements and things like that so this could give me the starting point to
        maybe eventually working there.There is no harm in getting information and I am really looking forward to it!  </p>
