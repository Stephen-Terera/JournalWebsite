            <p class=" spacing ">The NTU Volunteering team had a webinar to give students more information on the various Volunteering
              jobs and vacancies that we can take part in. In high school there was a volunteering program and I worked at a school for
              disabled children,Jairos Jiri school.The school has students from grade 1 to sixth form.My experience was eye opening and
              I was strongly considering volunteering in education but I also wanted to see what else was available which is why I attended
              this webinar.

            <p>Volunteering is divided into 5 groups: </p>
            <ul class="webinar">
              <li>Art,Sport and Culture</li>
              <li>Education and Attainment</li>
              <li>Health and wellbeing</li>
              <li>Crime and Justice</li>
              <li>Environment and Sustainability </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Each session focused on a different area of volunteering and had speakers from the organizations that you could potential help out 
              It looks like I will have to volunteer next term as I was unable to be there in person to volunteer.There were a few options that did not require me to physically be there
              but they were not as interesting or did not seem as fun as some of the other options that were available.
