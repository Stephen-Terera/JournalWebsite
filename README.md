# JournalWebsite
Online Journal detailing some of the extra-curricular activites I undertook during the first term of university. I used the website as proof that I did 
undertake extra activites and submitted it at the end of the first term. The website is a static one and is only made up of HTML and CSS.The images I used 
are not my own and I have credited them on the website and this website passed the university's plagarism test.
